### Introduction by [dboi88][dboi88]

> The Cargo Freighter was born out of a desire to move LARGE amounts of cargo around in sandbox and late game career saves. With a max part count of only 20 parts the days of building CPU breaking 300 parts ships are gone. While the Cargo Freighter performs its main role amicably it can also be set up to provide a variety of different configurations, including Arkships, passenger iners, debris removal and recycling, mobile construction centres and many more.

### Features

* Asymmetrical Design.
* Rear Truss & Main Hull Have Automatic Weight Balancing Feature.
* 5m Kontainer Docking Ports Integrated Into Rear Truss.
* Deliver Kontainers at your destination and bring back empties.
* Range Of Interchangeable Modules In Two Sizes.
* Internal EVA Prep Space With Small Kontainer/Storage Rack.
* None Career Game Breaking (parts are at the end of the tech tree and extremely expensive)
* Fuelled By The Insanely Expensive Karbundrum, You Will Need Mining Operations In Place
* Has To Be Built In Situ (If you manage to reach orbit with this please let me know :D)
* Custom CSI Freighter catagory for all freighter parts.
* Hanger Bay & Cargo Bays Support @allista's hanger mod allowing you to store crafts and re-spawn later.

### Installation Directions [^1]

  CurseForge/OverWolf App (currently does not install dependencies)

I take no part, nor am I interested in maintaining the [CKAN][ckan] mod metadata for my mods.

[CKAN][ckan] is a great mod for those that can't use zip tools.

If you are having issues please let the [CKAN][ckan] people know and refer to the [CKAN][ckan] thread.

My support of [CKAN][ckan] extends as far as me checking the checkbox in Spacedock when I upload.

Beware, [CKAN][ckan] *can* really mess up though it tries very, very, very hard not to.
